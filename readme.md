### API Design with 3 Endpoints

Each endpoint must have:
- Its own Controller file inside the Controller folder.
- Its own Service file inside a Service folder.

#### Endpoints:

1. **Sum of Two Numbers**  
   - Accepts 2 numbers.
   - Adds them together and prints the result in a sentence.  
     Example output: "The sum of 2 and 2 is 4."

2. **Name and Wake-Up Time**  
   - Accepts 2 inputs:  
     - What is your name?  
     - What time did you wake up?  
   - Outputs a sentence describing the person and their wake-up time.

3. **Comparison of Two Numbers**  
   - Accepts 2 numbers.
   - Prints the following statements:
     1. Whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.
     2. Whether the second number is greater than, less than, or equal to the first number.

#### Deliverables:
- Project, zipped
- GitHub link in comments
- Don't forget the peer review!

**Note:** Will not be hosted on Vercel.

### Overall Feedback

All three endpoints work. I was able to find the injection pretty easily in program.cs
Great job with including validations. Hopefully, we get to learn how to better handle validations with our APIs in the future.
